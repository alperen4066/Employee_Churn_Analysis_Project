# Employee_Churn_Analysis_Project
## WELCOME!
Welcome to "Employee Churn Analysis Project".

I performed  Exploratory data analysis and visualization of employee churn dataset using *matplotlib* and *seaborn, model building and evaluation using python scikit-learn* package.

I applied Random Forest, Gradient Descent Boosting , KNN algorithms. I also visualized the performances of the models using Seaborn, Matplotlib  in various ways.


At the end of the project, I had the opportunity to put my model into operation with the Streamlight API.
